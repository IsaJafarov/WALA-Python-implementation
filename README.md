This project is an impementation of the [WALA-Python](https://github.com/Anemone95/wala-python) Framework. In this project, by using the functionalities of the library, we  analyze Python scripts. The analysis includes
- building a CFG tree, 
- printing all basic blocks,
- counting the number of nodes,
- counting the number of instructions,
- counting the number of edges in the tree,
- calculating the average number of instructions per basic block,
- counting the number of branching statements,
- visiting instructions by creating a custom visitor.

Due to some unsolvable issues regarding dependencies, the project code has been written in the library. It includes all the classes in the *custom* package.

The Python scripts are in the *cast-python3/src/main/resources* folder. The scripts can be replaced with another project files.
